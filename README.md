# Introduction
Many cities all over the US including the DC area have undergone urban redevelopment and infill in the last 10 years. The theme of our project is to investigate this redevelopment and infill in DC and/or the surrounding area (e.g. College Park, Shady Grove). Redevelopment and infill refers to the process of adding more units of housing to an existing city.

# Purpose of our project
Describing the trend in redevelopment over time. Try to investiage and answer several questions. Is redevelopment increasing? Decreasing? For which neighborhoods is it increasing? For which is it decreasing?
